    				<p>"Where do I even begin, love every bit of this underated quaint cafe that's Hungarian family owned and run. I'd say one of if not the best burger in Sarasota IMO! (Not no regular American cheeseburger) Continuous rotating specials that are made with what's fresh that week, the chef is an amazing cook. He said it best everything is on the menu because it's spectacular and made with care/ love. Great place for a brunch/lunch outing with friends/ family or grabbing a nice dinner with a date, if you come on Friday nights they have a violinist that's spectacular. Can't go wrong with this place" -Mark Perkins July 2021</p> 
    				<p>"I was looking for a local/mom and pop place to have dinner last night. My wife said, "Sunnyside? But they're a breakfast place!" I'm sure the breakfast is great and I can't wait to give it a try, but as for dinner, I was impressed by every aspect of the place. It's a cozy atmosphere. Our server was attentive without being smothering. The food was amazing. We had pheasant stuffed crepes, seared tuna salad and a sandwich and all of it was excellent and fresh. Great local-owned place with great food!" -Justin Schwegel July 2021</p>
